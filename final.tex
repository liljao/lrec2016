\section{Introduction}
%323
With the increasing popularity of dependency-based representations of
syntactic structure in recent years, a wealth of different dependency
annotation schemes have surfaced. It has been shown that the choice of
dependency scheme influences parsing results \cite{Sch:Abe:Rap:12} as
well as down-stream applications \cite{Elm:Joh:Kle:13} and even though
attempts have been made to contrast different schemes theoretically
\cite{Iva:Oep:Ovr:12}, it is clear that the diversity of
representation makes comparisons difficult. Cross-linguistically even
more so, and it can often be difficult to tease apart
aspects of annotation scheme from typological differences in cross-lingual learning \cite{Soe:11,Skj:Ovr:12}.

Universal Dependencies (UD) \cite{Mar:Doz:Sil:14,Niv:15} is a recent
community-driven effort to create cross-linguistically consistent
syntactic annotation. UD is based on the Stanford dependency scheme
\cite{Mar:Mac:Man:06} which has become a widely used dependency scheme
for English in recent years.  A number of existing dependency
treebanks have been converted to UD \cite{Pyy:Kan:Miss:15,Niv:14}
and new data has also been annotated from scratch in order to enable
multilingual parser development, cross-lingual learning and
typological studies of syntactic structure. Treebanks involved in this
effort represent a diverse range of languages such as English, German,
Swedish, Spanish, Italian, Persian, Japanese, and the UD release 1.1
contains treebanks for as many as 34 different languages of varying
sizes.

This paper describes a fully automatic conversion procedure for the
Norwegian Dependency Treebank (NDT) to UD. Due to differences both in
the tag set, as well as structural analyses, the conversion requires
non-trivial transformations of the dependency trees, in addition to
mappings of tags and labels that make reference to a combination of
various kinds of linguistic information.  This paper details the
mapping of PoS tags, morphological features and dependency relations
and provides a description of the structural changes made to NDT
analyses in order to make it compliant with the UD guidelines. We
further present the PoS-tagging and dependency parsing experiments which
contrast the performance of several state-of-the-art taggers and
parsers on the original and converted treebank. The full converted
treebank was made available with the 1.2 release of the UD treebanks
\cite{Niv:Mar:Gin:16}.


\section{NDT and UD}
%138
The Norwegian Dependency Treebank (NDT) \cite{Sol:Skj:Ovr:14} contains
morphological and syntactic dependency annotation for both varieties
of written Norwegian (Bokm{\aa}l and Nynorsk).\footnote{The current
  Norwegian UD treebank contains the data from the Bokm√•l section of
  the treebank which consists of 311,000 tokens. There are plans to
  include the Nynorsk data in the next UD release.} The morphological
annotation follows the Oslo-Bergen Tagger scheme
\cite{Hag:Joh:Nok:00}.  The syntactic annotation scheme is, to a large
extent, based on the Norwegian Reference Grammar
\cite{Faa:Lie:Van:97} and the dependency representations are
inspired by choices made in comparable treebanks, in particular the
Swedish treebank Talbanken \cite{Niv:Nil:Hal:2006}.
\newcite{Skj:14} quantified inter-annotator agreement using a chance-corrected metric derived from
Krippendorff's $\alpha$ and showed that agreement on the NDT data is high: scoring an $\alpha$ of about
98\%, among the highest of all the data sets studied.
The annotation guidelines \cite{Kin:Sol:Eri:2013} describe the annotation scheme in some detail and Table \ref{tb:choices} summarizes the main annotation choices in NDT \cite{Sol:Skj:Ovr:14}.

Universal Dependencies (UD) builds on several previous initiatives for
universally common morphological \cite{Zem:08,Pet:Das:McD:12} and
syntactic dependency \cite{McD:Niv:Qui:13,Ros:Mas:Mar:14}
annotation. Among its main tenets are the primacy of content-words,
i.e. content words, as opposed to function words, are syntactic heads
wherever possible. It is intended to be a universal annotation scheme,
i.e. applicable to any language, however also offers some
possibilities for language-specific information. With reference to the
NDT annotation choices in Table \ref{tb:choices}, the UD scheme adopts
the reverse attachment for auxiliaries, infinitival markers and
prepositions.

\section{Parts-of-speech}
% 78 + 287 = 365
The part-of-speech tag set used in the UD scheme is based on the
Universal PoS tag set of \newcite{Pet:Das:McD:12} and contains 17 tags. The NDT tag set
contains 19 tags.  The conversion of the part-of-speech information in
NDT to the UD pos tag set is fairly straightforward and largely relies
on a direct mapping presented in Table \ref{tb:pos}.  A few
parts-of-speech require conversion rules which make reference to
additional information in the treebank, represented by disjunction
in the mapping. Below we will discuss a few of these cases.

        \LL
    }

The universal scheme makes a distinction between proper and common
nouns at the part-of-speech level. This information can be found among
the morphological features in NDT ({\tt prop}), hence the mapping is
straightforward.

For verbs UD distinguishes auxiliaries ({\tt AUX}) from main
verbs ({\tt VERB}).  This distinction is not explicitly made in
NDT, hence our conversion procedure must make use of the syntactic
structure of the verbs in order to implement this distinction. Verbs
that have a direct, non-finite dependent (a dependent with the NDT
dependency relation {\sc inf}) are marked as auxiliaries and all other
verbs as regular verbs.

The relative pronoun {\it som} 'who/that' is analyzed as a subjunction
in NDT, whereas the universal scheme, and thus our conversion, uses
the pronominal tag {\tt PRON} for these words.

NDT explicitly marks headings using the {\tt |} symbol, tagged as a
clause boundary ({\tt clb}) along with information in the
morphological features {\tt <overskrift>}. These are converted to the
UD symbol tag {\tt SYM}.

Numerical expressions, e.g. {\it to} 'two' or {\it 45} are tagged as
determiners in NDT, also when they do not explicitly modify a nominal,
e.g. {\it de to gjorde en imponerende innsats} 'the two did an
impressive job'. These are however marked as 'kvant'
(quantificational) in the morphological features, hence the conversion
mapping makes reference to this property in order to distinguish {\tt NUM} from {\tt DET}.

NDT implements a somehwat broader definition of prepositions than the UD
scheme and includes several cases which are counted as adverbs in the
universal schemes. In particular, this is the case for demonstrative
adverbs such as {\it her} 'here' and {\it der} 'there'. These are
followingly converted to adverbs ({\tt ADV}) in the PoS conversion, whereas all
other prepositions are converted to {\tt ADP}.

\section{Morphological information}
%109
In addition to part-of-speech information, NDT contains a rich
inventory of morphological features, e.g. information about properties
like gender, definiteness, tense, voice, etc. The UD guidelines
specify a universal set of morphological features and the conversion
between the two does not require reference to
information in addition to the feature information. The feature
mapping is described in Table \ref{tb:feats}.  Note that since the
number of UD features is larger than the NDT features, some of the NDT
features correspond to a set of UD features, e.g. the NDT features for
verbs ({\tt pres, pret}) which instantiate both the {\tt Mood, Tense}
and {\tt VerbForm} features.

\section{Structural conversion}
%63
The NDT annotation scheme differs structurally from the UD scheme in
a number of important ways.  The conversion is therefore non-trivial
and requires a set of structural rules which operate on the dependency
graphs in addition to a mapping procedure over the dependency labels.
The conversion is implemented as a cascade of structural rules followed by a
relation conversion procedure over the modified graph structures.
The structural rules employ a small set of graph operations that reverse, reattach, delete and add arcs.

\subsection{Root}
%52
In NDT, there is no designated root label. Rather, the root of the
dependency graph may have different labels, e.g. {\tt FINV} (finite
verb) or {\tt FRAG} (fragment), depending on the structure of the
sentence. In the conversion, every node with the dummy node (0) as
head receives the {\tt root} relation.

\subsection{Verbal groups}
%106
NDT consistently marks the finite verb as head of a clause, with other
non-finite verbs as dependents ({\tt INFV}), see example
(\ref{ex:verb}a). In a parallel manner, infinitival markers are also
annotated as heads with the infinitival verb as its dependent, see
(\ref{ex:infmark}a). UD on the other hand annotates the lexical, main
verb as head of the verbal group and various finite and non-finite
auxiliaries receive an auxiliary relation ({\tt aux, auxpass}) , see
(\ref{ex:verb}b) and (\ref{ex:infmark}b) below.  The conversion rule
locates the main verb within the chain of nonfinite dependents of the
finite verb and makes this node the head of the other verbs in the
chain.

    \depedge{3}{2}{\large aux}
    \deproot[edge unit distance=1.5ex]{3}{}
    \end{dependency}
\end{minipage}
\end{examples}


\subsection{Copula constructions}
%42
The treatment of copula constructions within the UD scheme differs
markedly from that of the NDT by appointing the predicative element as
head of the entire construction and attaching the copula verb with a
special relation {\tt cop}, see (\ref{ex:cop}b). Our conversion thus
reverses the arc between the copula and its complement and reattaches
all its dependents to the predicative element.
%68
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ex:cop}
\begin{minipage}[t]{3cm}
a)
    \begin{dependency}[arc edge, text only label, theme=simple]
        \begin{deptext}[column sep=.2cm]
            de \& er \& fattige \\
            \w{they} \& \w{are} \& \w{poor}\\
        \end{deptext}
    \depedge{2}{1}{\large\sc subj}
    \depedge{2}{3}{\large\sc spred}
    \deproot[edge unit distance=1.5ex]{2}{\large\sc finv}
    \end{dependency}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.5cm}
\begin{minipage}[t]{3cm}
b)
%\item\label{ex:ndt-verb}
    \begin{dependency}[arc edge, text only label, theme=simple]
        \begin{deptext}[column sep=.4cm]
            de \& er \& fattige\\
            \w{they} \& \w{are} \& \w{poor}\\
        \end{deptext}
    \depedge{3}{1}{\large nsubj}
    \depedge{3}{2}{\large cop}
    \deproot[edge unit distance=1.5ex]{3}{\large root}
    \end{dependency}
\end{minipage}
\end{examples}


\subsection{Prepositions and their complements}
%47
In NDT, prepositions are heads of their prepositional complements
which receive the {\tt PUTFYLL} label, see (\ref{ex:prep}a). Seeing
that languages differ greatly in their use of pre/postpositions, the
UD scheme annotates the prepositional complement as head and attaches
the preposition using the {\tt case} relation, see (\ref{ex:prep}b). In conversion this is once again a matter of reversing the arc and reattaching dependents to the new head.
%56
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ex:prep}
\begin{minipage}[t]{2.5cm}
a)
    \begin{dependency}[arc edge, text only label, theme=simple]
        \begin{deptext}[column sep=.2cm]
            p{\aa} \& menyen \\
            \w{on} \& \w{menu-the} \\
        \end{deptext}
    \depedge{1}{2}{\large\sc putfyll}
    \deproot[edge unit distance=1.5ex]{1}{}
    \end{dependency}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.5cm}
\begin{minipage}[t]{2.5cm}
b)
    \begin{dependency}[arc edge, text only label, theme=simple]
        \begin{deptext}[column sep=.2cm]
            p{\aa} \& menyen \\
            \w{on} \& \w{menu-the} \\
        \end{deptext}
    \depedge{2}{1}{\large case}
    \deproot[edge unit distance=1.5ex]{2}{}
    \end{dependency}
\end{minipage}
\end{examples}


\subsection{Predicatives}
%119
NDT distinguishes several types of predicatives, both predicatives
that are arguments of verbs (subject predicative {\tt SPRED} and
object predicative {\tt OPRED}) and ``free predicatives'' which are
not arguments of the verb, but nonetheless characterize either a
subject or an object in the preceding context (free subject
predicative {\tt FSPRED} and free object predicative {\tt
  FOPRED}). Both of these are attached to the finite verb in NDT, as we can see in (\ref{ex:pred}a). In a
similar manner, UD distinguishes between obligatory and optional
predicatives, where the former are analyzed using the {\tt xcomp}
relation and attached to the main predicate, whereas the optional
predicatives are attached as adverbial clauses ({\tt acl}) modifying the argument
they characterize, see (\ref{ex:pred}b). Our conversion thus attaches the {\tt FSPRED} argument to its sibling subject argument, {\tt FOPRED} to an object sibling.
%65
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ex:pred}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
    \begin{dependency}[arc edge, text only label, theme=simple]
        \begin{deptext}[column sep=.2cm]
          taler \& Solstad \& uredd \\
          \w{speaks} \& \w{Solstad} \& \w{unscared} \\
        \end{deptext}
            \depedge{1}{2}{\large\sc subj}
            \depedge{1}{3}{\large\sc fspred}
            \deproot[edge unit distance=1.5ex]{1}{}
    \end{dependency}
\item[(b)]
    \begin{dependency}[arc edge, text only label, theme=simple]
        \begin{deptext}[column sep=.2cm]
          taler \& Solstad \& uredd \\
          \w{speaks} \& \w{Solstad} \& \w{unscared} \\
        \end{deptext}
            \depedge{1}{2}{\large nsubj}
            \depedge{2}{3}{\large acl}
            \deproot[edge unit distance=1.5ex]{1}{}
    \end{dependency}
\end{itemize}
\end{examples}


\subsection{Coordination}
%65
Coordination is a phenomenon which exhibits considerable variation in terms
of dependency representation across various annotation schemes \cite{Pop:Mar:Ste:13}.
As we can see from the example in (\ref{ex:coord}), the analyses
chosen in the NDT and UD schemes are fairly similar in their choice of
the first conjunct as head of the coordinate structure. They differ
mainly in the attachment of the conjunction and the relation names.
%88
\begin{example}
\label{ex:coord}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
    \begin{dependency}[arc edge, text only label, theme=simple]
        \begin{deptext}[column sep=.2cm]

          \w{scallops} \& , \& \w{turbot} \& \w{and} \& \w{lambfilet}\\

            \depedge{5}{4}{\large\sc konj}
            \deproot[edge unit distance=1.5ex]{1}{}

    \end{dependency}
\end{itemize}

\end{example}

\section{Conversion of dependency relations}
%105
A minority of the dependency relations in NDT may be converted
directly, based on the mapping described in Table \ref{tb:dep}, the
rest require the formulation of mapping constraints which make
reference to information in addition to the dependency relation
itself, i.e. part-of-speech tag, morphological features, dependency
structure or even a combination of these. An overview of
the non-direct mapping of dependency relations that require additional
information from the linguistic context is provided in Table \ref{tb:multidep}.
These mappings often also require heuristics which approximate some
syntactic property which is not explicitly annotated in NDT. Below we
will present these heuristics and their usage in the conversion.

%118
\paragraph{Active/Passive}There are two ways of expressing passive voice in Norwegian: a
morphological passive expressed by an addition of a {\it -s} to the
verb, e.g. {\it danses} 'to be danced' or a periphrastic passive which
is composed of the auxiliary {\it bli} 'to become' and a participle
form, e.g. {\it danset} 'danced'. Only the morphological passive is
marked explicitly as being in the passive voice.  We therefore define
a heuristic which counts a lexical main verb as passive, if it is (i)
a morphological passive, or (ii) is a participle headed by a form of
the auxiliary {\it bli}.  This heuristic is used in the conversion of
passive auxiliaries {\tt auxpass} and passive subjects {\tt nsubjpass,
  csubjpass}.

%128
\paragraph{Nominal/Clausal}Several of the UD relations assume a distinction between nominal and
clausal elements. This distinction is complicated somewhat by the fact
that in copula constructions, as described above, the complement of
the copula is head of the construction as a whole. This means that
adjectives or even nouns may be counted as clausal in contexts where
they have a copula dependent, as in (\ref{ex:cop}b).  In the
conversion we introduce a notion of a \emph{predicate}, which may be
either verbal ({\tt AUX, VERB}) or the complement in a copula
construction. This notion is used to distinguish nominal and clausal
subjects ({\tt nsubj, nsubjpass} vs. {\tt csubj, csubjpass}), objects
({\tt dobj} vs. {\tt ccomp, xcomp}), various modifiers ({\tt nmod}
vs. {\tt acl}) and adverbials ({\tt nmod} vs. {\tt advcl}).
%TO-DO: adverb subjects?? footnote

\paragraph{Control}UD is inspired by the syntactic framework of Lexical Functional
Grammar \cite{Kap:Bre:82} and adopts its distinction between complement
clauses with obligatory subject control ({\tt xcomp}) and those without
({\tt ccomp}). The notion of control is not native to NDT, hence we
approximate it by requiring the presence of an explicit subject dependent of the
head verb of the clause.


%45
\paragraph{Negation}UD distinguishes negation modifiers which modify either a noun ({\it
  no problem}) or a predicate (in the aforementioned sense) ({\it is
  not a problem, doesn't argue}). Our conversion explicitly marks the
negative determiner ({\it ingen} 'no') and the negative adverb ({\it
  ikke} 'not') in Norwegian.

%141
\paragraph{Particles}NDT distinguishes between transitive and intransitive prepositions, or
so-called particles, in the annotation. In order to account for the
relation between the verb and its particle we introduce the
language-specific relation {\tt compound:prt}, for prepositions which
are attached to a verb and furthermore does not have an explicit prepositional complement,
e.g. {\it si opp} 'discontinue' (lit. 'say up').
On manual inspection of the
converted data we find that this conversion also gives us the
preposition in fixed expressions which require the combination of a
verb, direct object and a preposition, such as {\it snu ryggen til}
'turn (ones) back to' as well as certain fixed combinations of
prepositions which function as a whole syntactically, e.g. {\it til og
  med} 'even (lit. to and with)'. Without any existing annotation
distinguishing these from the regular particle constructions these are
difficult to differentiate automatically.


\paragraph{Relative clauses}The analyses of relative clauses differ notably between the two
annotation schemes. Both schemes treat the relative clause as a
clausal modifier of a nominal element ({\tt ATR} vs {\tt acl}),
however the treatment of the relative marker/pronoun differs. NDT
treats relative markers as subordinating conjunctions which depend on
the finite verb of the relative clause,\footnote{They argue for this
  by pointing to the fact that relative markers unlike many other
  languages do not conjugate (who-whom, der-die-das) and only occur
  initially in a subordinate clause \cite{Faa:Lie:Van:97}} UD treats
the relative marker as a pronoun which occupies an argument relation
in the relative clause. In our conversion we introduce a
language-specific variant of the clausal relation {\tt acl}, {\tt
  acl:relcl} which signals that this is a relative clause. The
relative marker {\it som} 'that' receives an argument role based on a
heuristic which checks for the presence or absence of other argument
siblings.

\section{The converted treebank}
Following the conversion of the Norwegian Dependency Treebank to
Universal Dependencies scheme, 51.5\% of the tokens in the original treebank
were reattached. The resulting treebank contains 17 PoS tags and 35 different
morphological features for 311,277 tokens of Norwegian Bokm√•l.

All UD treebanks consist of three data sets: a training, development
and test set. In creating these data splits for Norwegian, care has
been taken to preserve contiguous texts in the different splits and
also to keep a balance of genres in each of the splits. Table
\ref{tb:splits} shows an overview of the Norwegian UD data sets in
terms of tokens and sentences.

\section{Tagging and parsing}
Without a gold standard for Norwegian UD dependencies it is difficult
to evaluate our conversion directly. We may however, evaluate
PoS-tagging and dependency parsing performance for the converted
treebank.  In the following we report on a set of experiments which
investigate the performance of a set of state-of-the-art PoS-taggers
and parsers trained and evaluated on the converted Norwegian UD
treebank.

As noted in previous work \cite{Mar:Doz:Sil:14}, several of the design
choices of the UD scheme, such as the attachment of auxiliaries and
prepositions, are known to cause a drop in parsing accuracy
\cite{Sch:Abe:Rap:12}.

Danish parsing experiments: \cite{Joh:Alo:Pla:15} orig 84.38 -> ud 81.56
Bulgarian \cite{Ose:Sim:15}: orig 89.14 -> ud 83.5

The tagging was performed by SVMTool\footnote{\url{cs.upc.edu/~nlp/SVMTool}}
employing strategy 1, which proved to be optimal for parsing NDT in previous
work ((Hohle, 2016; forthcoming)). The original tag set of NDT comprises 19
tags, 12 of which are morphosyntactic tags, while its fine-grained counterpart
(concatenation of tag and set of morphological features) totals 368 tags. The
corresponding fine-grained tag set of UD comprises 169 tags. We see that
tagging accuracy is higher on NDT with the original tag set, while UD surpasses
NDT when using the fine-grained tag set. This is as expected, as the
fine-grained tag set of NDT contains almost 200 more tags than that of UD,
which markedly complicates the tagging.

%% \paragraph{Relative clauses}
%% In many languages, relative markers are pronouns. In Norwegian, there
%% are good reasons for choosing to treat the relative marker {\it som}
%% 'that' as a subjunction \cite{Faa:Lie:Van:97}. This relative marker,
%% unlike those found in many other languages does not inflect (as in
%% English {\it who-whom}, or German {\it der-die-das}) and exclusively
%% occurs initially in a subordinate clause. In our conversion we
%% introduce a language-specific variant of the clausal relation {\tt
%%   acl}, {\tt acl:relcl} which signals that this is a relative clause.
%% %% The relative marker {\it som} 'that' receives an argument role based

%% \subsection{Numerical modifiers}
%% UD distinguishes numerical modifiers of nouns, e.g. {\it 42,
%%   fifty}. These are annotated as regular determiners in NDT, but are
%% part of a larger group of quantifiers which receive the additional
%% feature {\tt kvant}, e.g. {\it noen} 'some', {\it ingen} 'no'. In
%% order to distinguish the numerical modifiers from the other
%% quantifying determiners, we use a regular expression which recognizes
%% digits and numerical expressions like {\it trettito} 'thirty-two'.
